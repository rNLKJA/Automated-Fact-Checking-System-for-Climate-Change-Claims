The numbers are generally quite high, indicating that it is a fairly easy classification task. In terms of the best classifier, the clear standouts here are the SVM and Logistic Regression classifiers, while <i>k</i>NN is clearly the worst. One reason <i>k</i>NN might be doing poorly is that it is particularly susceptible to a noisy feature space with dimensions that are irrelevant to the task. Let's try to improve performance by removing stopwords and doing lowercasing"
