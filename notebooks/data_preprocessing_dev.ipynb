    "\n",
    "2. **TF-IDF for Evidence Retrieval**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Preprocessing*: Clean and preprocess the evidence paragraphs to optimize them for TF-IDF vectorization (e.g., removing stopwords, punctuation, and normalizing text).\n",
    "- *Vectorization*: Apply TF-IDF vectorization to the preprocessed evidence paragraphs to create a matrix representing the importance of terms in each document.\n",
    "- *Similarity Calculation*: When a new claim is received, convert it into a TF-IDF vector using the same vectorizer and calculate its cosine similarity against the TF-IDF matrix to find the most relevant evidences.\n",

    "3. **Construct an Evidence List**:\n",

    "\n",
    "- *Model Building*: Build a Word2Vec model from scratch using PyTorch to learn word embeddings from the concatenated text of claims and their relevant evidences.\n",

    "\n",
    "6. **Classification**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Approach*: Use the embeddings from the Word2Vec model along with additional features (if necessary) to classify the claim into one of four predefined categories.\n",
    "- *Model Selection*: Depending on the complexity and nature of the classification, choose an appropriate machine learning or deep learning model. This could be a simple logistic regression, a support vector machine, or a more complex neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Considerations for Implementation**:\n",
    "- *Modularity*: Each step should be encapsulated within its class or function to ensure modularity and ease of maintenance.\n",
    "- *Scalability*: Design the system to handle increases in data volume efficiently, possibly by optimizing data handling and processing.\n",
    "- *Extensibility*: Allow for easy updates and modifications, such as adding new preprocessing steps, changing the classification model, or adjusting the number of top evidences retrieved."

    "## 2. **TF-IDF for Evidence Retrieval**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Text preprocessing is an essential step in our pipeline, aiming to transform raw text into a format that's more analyzable and meaningful. This step involves cleaning the text, reducing words to their base or root form, removing irrelevant characters and words that do not contribute to the semantic meaning of the text, and enriching the text to retain more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "Our preprocessing workflow integrates several techniques to refine the text data comprehensively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contraction Expansion**: Converts contractions (e.g., \"isn't\" to \"is not\") into their expanded forms to standardize text and improve analysis accuracy.\n",
    "2. **Tokenization and Lowercasing**: Splits text into individual words or tokens and transforms all text to lowercase to ensure consistency and avoid duplication based on case differences.\n",
    "3. **Special Characters Removal**: Deletes non-word characters (e.g., punctuation) to focus on the textual content, followed by removing duplicated spaces to clean the text further.\n",
    "4. **Part-of-Speech Tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies the grammatical parts of speech for each word and recognizes named entities (e.g., \"South Australia\") as unique tokens. This step is crucial for maintaining the specificity of geographical locations, organizations, and individuals in the text.\n",
    "5. **Text Enrichment**: Enhances text by adding synonyms, hyponyms, and antonyms based on the part-of-speech, avoiding duplicates to enrich the content without altering the original meaning significantly.\n",
    "6. **Stop Words Removal**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the preprocessing function, it's a common step that involves eliminating commonly used words (e.g., \"the\", \"is\") that usually have little to no semantic value in the context of text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "The `preprocess_text` method encapsulates the preprocessing steps, taking a string of text as input. This method is a critical component of the `TfidfEvidenceRetriever` class, which preprocesses both the query and the documents in the corpus to ensure a standardized format for TF-IDF vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `preprocess` method orchestrates the preprocessing of the entire dataset stored in a DataFrame. It utilizes the tqdm library to display a progress bar, providing real-time feedback on the preprocessing status, and prepares the text for subsequent TF-IDF vectorization and similarity comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Consider the claim: \"[South Australia] has the most expensive electricity in the world.\" During preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contraction Expansion & Lowercasing**: No contractions are present; \"South Australia\" is lowercased.\n",
    "2. **Special Characters Removal**: Assumes no special characters; the text remains unchanged. Duplicated spaces are removed.\n",
    "3. **Tokenization & Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Splits the text into tokens and tags them.\n",
    "4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies \"South Australia\" as a named entity and preserves it as a unique token.\n",
    "5. **Text Enrichment**: Enriches the text by adding synonyms, hyponyms, and antonyms for relevant words based on their part-of-speech tags.\n",
    "6. **Lemmatization & Stop Words Removal**: \"has\" -> \"have\", \"expensive\" remains, \"electricity\" remains, removing \"the\", \"in\", \"world\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing results in a focused representation of the claim, highlighting the key components, preserving the named entity \"South Australia\" for precise evidence retrieval, and enriching the text to enhance the analysis."
